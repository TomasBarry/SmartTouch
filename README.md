# Smart Touch
Smart Touch is a Chrome extension that brings some of the touchscreen
functionalities found in phones (such as __pull down to refresh__) to
other touchscreen enabled devices.

### Other features
---
Smart touch also adds support for gestures that will preform user defined actions. Right now these gestures are limited to:

* Double Tap (Left side | Right Side)
* Triple Tap (Left side | Right Side)


Preforming these gestures will preform some user specified action.

### Current Functionality
---
Right now gestures are limited to tap gestures and and pull to refresh, however this will be expanded on in later versions.

### To Do
---
* Provide a code template for users experienced with Javascript to add their own custom gestures.
* Expand on the variety of supported gestures.
* Provide users with a settings page where they can change actions that gestures preform.
